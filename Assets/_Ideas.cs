****Working Ideas****

-- Worker Ant
    --Worker Ant just follows pheramone trails to food.
    --Worker Ant loiters around Colony Hive until scent is found
    
-- Scout Ant
    --Scout Ant searches out from the Colony Hive to find food and Danger
    --Scout Ant returns food to hive but does not follow pheramone trails to food
    --Scout Ant moves faster than other ants
    
-- Queen Ant
    --Queen Ant takes gathered food and creates larve
    -*5 food create a larve
    --Queen Ant moves slower than other ants

-- Warrior Ant
    --Warrior Ant protects the Queen Ant and other ants

****Future Ideas****

)) Procedural Generated Terrain    
)) Ability to Create new Hives
)) Underground view of Hive
)) Other Ants?
)) Enemy Colonies -- NPC Colonies
)) Enemy Bugs (Spider, Beetle, etc)
)) Use further Design Patterns
)) Introduce some randomness
)) Ants have age
)) Ants have skill? (ie better fighter/worker/faster scout/ slower scout)

****Player Interaction****

Player chooses type of Ant created from Larve

****Graphic Implementations****

Small amount of GUI for Ant selection
Colony statistics
    # of Hives
    # of Ants by type
    # of Ants total
    # of Food gathered/available 
Ant model
Different food types
Different obstacles
Different Terrain types
